# 🌿 Plant Disease Classification

Hi! I'm **Amit**, and this is a classical Machine Learning project where I built a **Plant Disease Classification system** to detect different types of plant diseases from images.

---

## 📽️ Project Overview

- This project uses **machine learning models** to classify plant leaf images into different disease categories.
- It's a classic project that many beginners attempt, and it gave me valuable hands-on experience in **model training**, **image preprocessing**, **model evaluation**, and **deployment**.
- I extended the standard implementation by integrating the trained model with **Streamlit**, turning it into an interactive and user-friendly web app.
- This is a **solo project** built for personal learning and practice, helping me improve my ML workflow knowledge and deployment skills.
